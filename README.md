Good job for getting here, monsieur.

In order to continue, open another tab in the terminal and clone the repo; 
``` git clone https://github.com/tomcritchley/Romainsgift.git ```
``` cd Romainsgift ```
``` python3 hangman.py ```

Make sure you leave the other script running otherwise you will have to start again like a loser

Good luck!
